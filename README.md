Pronoun Bot is a Discord bot for transgender, nonbinary, genderqueer, and any other gender-questioning people that can be used to try out new pronouns and names. It was written in Node.js

## How to use me

This bot uses slash commands and will tell you how to fill in the information it needs, but if not `/commands` will give you more information.
- You can use `/help` to learn how pronouns and the bot works
- Use `/try` to try out individual pronouns in a set
- Use `/try-set` to try out a set separated by '/'s
- Use `/try-none` to try using no pronouns (only a name)
- Use `/try-all` to try using all pronouns
- Use `/try-noun` to try using a noun for pronouns
- Use `/try-random` to let the bot pick a random set of pronouns for you

You can choose to specify a name or leave it blank if you're unsure, and you can specify whether the pronouns are plural or singular.

The bot will generate some sentences for you so you can see if these pronouns are right for you!
