# Pronoun Bot

Pronoun Bot is a Discord bot for transgender, nonbinary, genderqueer, and any other gender-questioning people that can be used to try out new pronouns and names. It was written in Node.js

## How to use me

- You can use /help to learn how pronouns and the bot works
- Use `/try` to try out individual pronouns in a set
- Use `/try-set` to try out a set separated by '/'s
- Use `/try-none` to try using no pronouns (only a name)

You can choose to specify a name or leave it blank if you're unsure, and you can specify whether the pronouns are plural or singular.

The bot will generate some sentences for you so you can see if these pronouns are right for you!
